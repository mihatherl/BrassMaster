/**
 * Tempo: what speed is in force at a beat, and the arithmetic that turns a
 * varying tempo into seconds.
 *
 * The same shape as `metre.ts` and `keys.ts` on purpose — "what is in force
 * at beat b" is a question a part asks of its tempo as well as its key and
 * its metre. The events are plain data a generator settles once; the compiled
 * map answers questions. The transport consumes a map; it does not define one.
 *
 * With tempo varying linearly across a span, both directions are closed form:
 * no numeric integration, no accumulated drift, and the inverse is a real
 * inverse rather than a search — which matters, because the render loop asks
 * time → beat sixty times a second while the scheduler asks beat → time.
 *
 * Where `bpm(b) = bpm₀ + m·(b − b₀)` across a span starting at `b₀`:
 *
 *   seconds(b) = (60/m)·ln(bpm(b) / bpm₀)
 *   beats(s)   = (bpm₀/m)·(e^(m·s/60) − 1)
 *
 * `m = 0` degenerates to a multiplication and is branched on, so a constant
 * tempo costs what it always cost.
 *
 * Three properties every caller leans on:
 *
 *  - **Total over negative beats.** The count-in lives there, at the opening
 *    tempo — which is also what a real count-in does. Events before or on
 *    beat 0 are refused, so the region behind the music is always flat.
 *  - **A hold sits between the beats.** A `hold` is a dwell: the beat stands
 *    still while a fixed number of seconds pass. Time on the far side of the
 *    dwell includes it, so a note on the boundary beat sounds — and is judged
 *    — at the release, not the arrival. The inverse plateaus at the held
 *    beat, which is the display honestly standing still.
 *  - **Monotone both ways.** Never strictly so through a dwell, and no caller
 *    requires that; the transport's scheduling horizon plateaus at a hold and
 *    scheduling pauses by itself.
