/**
 * Metre: the difference between what is written, how long a bar is, and what
 * you actually feel.
 *
 * Three things get called "the beat" and they are only the same thing in simple
 * time, which is why they are separated here before anything depends on it.
 *
 *  - **The time unit** is the crotchet. Everything in the app measures duration
 *    in crotchets, so `timeForBeat` is a multiplication and a dotted crotchet is
 *    just 1.5. That choice is right and is not what varies.
 *  - **The written signature** is the pair of numbers on the stave. 6/8 says
 *    six quavers; it does not say a bar is six of anything the clock counts.
 *  - **The pulse** is what a conductor beats and a metronome should click. In
 *    6/8 that is a dotted crotchet, two to a bar — *not* six.
 *
 * The numerator and the length of a bar in crotchets are equal only while the
 * denominator is 4, which is every metre the app currently offers. So the two
 * have been indistinguishable so far and would silently diverge the first time
 * anyone chose 6/8: bar lines in the wrong place, quavers beamed in twos where
 * they should be in threes, and a metronome clicking three times a bar in
 * musically meaningless places.
