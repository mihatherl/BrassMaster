/**
 * A rounded rectangle, drawn from arcs rather than by `ctx.roundRect`.
 *
 * **This is the only reason the app renders on a 2022 phone.** `roundRect`
 * arrived in Chrome 99 in March 2022, and an Android device whose System
 * WebView has not been updated is older than that — on a Motorola E32 it threw
 * `ctx.roundRect is not a function`, which took the whole app down in three
 * different ways: the play surface's frame loop died mid-run and the notation
 * froze while the metronome played on, paged mode threw on its first frame and
 * drew nothing at all, and the results screen's weak-note chart threw into
 * React and unmounted the tree to a white screen.
 *
 * `arcTo` has been in every browser since canvas existed. The lesson is wider
 * than this method: **the notation path must hold to old APIs**, because it is
 * the one part of the app that runs every frame and the one whose failure
 * looks like a bug in the music rather than a bug in the browser.
