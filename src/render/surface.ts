/**
 * The play surface, in either of two reading modes.
 *
 * **Scrolling** moves the music past a fixed strike line. The line says exactly
 * when to play, which makes it a good way to learn fingerings.
 *
 * **Paged** holds the music still and turns the page as the player approaches
 * the end of it. Nothing on the stave marks the beat — only the metronome or
 * the conductor, neither of which is part of the notation — so the player has
 * to count for themselves, which is what reading actually involves. The
 * scrolling line quietly does the hardest part of sight-reading for you.
 *
 * Both modes are the same drawing code with a different origin: scrolling
 * follows the playhead continuously, paged moves on a page at a time. Judging
 * is identical in both, since it works from scheduled beat times and never from
 * anything on screen.
 *
 * They differ in how the music is spaced, and they have to. Scrolling music is
 * spaced by how fast it should travel, so a beat is always the same distance —
 * uneven spacing would make it surge and stall as it crossed the strike line.
 * Paged music stands still and is engraved instead: room follows the notes
 * rather than the barlines, so a bar of semiquavers takes most of a line and a
 * bar holding one semibreve is short. See `spacing.ts`.
 *
 * Each frame reads the current beat from the transport — which reads the audio
 * clock — and positions everything from that. The render loop never accumulates
 * its own time, so a dropped frame costs a frame of smoothness and nothing else;
 * the notation cannot drift out of step with the sound.
