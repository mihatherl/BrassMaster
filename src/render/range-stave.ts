/**
 * The two ends of a range, drawn where they live.
 *
 * The same argument as `note-chart.ts`: a bound named "G flat 3" asks the
 * reader to translate a letter, an accidental and an octave back into a place
 * on a stave, and the player who needs this app is the one for whom that
 * translation is the difficulty. So the bounds are semibreves on a stave, with
 * the fingering above each in the same relation the play surface puts it in.
 *
 * What this does that the fingering chart does not, and the reason it is its own
 * renderer rather than another caller of that one: **it makes room for whatever
 * it is given, furniture included.** The chart reserves a fixed thirteen
 * spaces, which is enough for notes near the stave and not enough for the ends
 * of a brass compass — a written C#3 in treble clef sits four and a half spaces
 * below the bottom line, exactly where that canvas stops. Here every extent is
 * measured, because the whole point of this figure is to show the extremes.
 *
 * The notes themselves are placed the way the chart places its own: evenly
 * across whatever is left after the clef and the key signature have taken their
 * room. The dials sit either side of the figure rather than beneath the notes,
 * so nothing outside the canvas depends on where in it a note lands — which is
 * what lets the header be measured rather than budgeted for, and lets the
 * figure stay legible when it is squeezed between two controls.
