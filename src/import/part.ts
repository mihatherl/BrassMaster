/**
 * Reading one part of a MusicXML score into an `Exercise`.
 *
 * The third and largest piece of the importer. `unfold.ts` decides which
 * measures are played and in what order; this reads what is in them and hands
 * the result to `assembleExercise`, which is the same function the generator
 * ends at — so an imported part is beamed, bracketed and given its accidentals
 * by exactly the code that draws generated material, rather than by a second
 * set of rules that would drift.
 *
 * ## Everything is read in playing order, not written order
 *
 * MusicXML attributes are sticky: `divisions`, the key and the time signature
 * hold until something changes them. Once repeats are unfolded, "what is in
 * force here" is a question about where the *walk* has got to and not about
 * where the measure sits on the page — a key change inside a repeated section
 * comes into force twice, at two different beats. So the state is carried
 * through the playing order, and `keys` and `metres` are built from the beats
 * the changes actually land on.
 *
 * ## What is dropped, and the rule that decides it
 *
 * Settled with the player on 2026-08-11 and recorded in
 * `docs/musicxml-import-plan.md`:
 *
 * > **A rest is the correct substitute only for something that occupies time.**
 *
 * So articulations, dynamics and slurs go silently — they occupy no time and
 * change no fingering. Grace notes go and are counted. A chord gives up its
 * **top** note rather than becoming a rest, because a chord occupies time and
 * is playable, and on a single-line instrument the top note is the part. Only
 * something that occupies time and cannot be read becomes silence.
 *
 * Underneath all of it: **whatever is dropped, the bar count must not shift.**
 * A player navigates by bar number, and a substitution that shortened a bar
 * would misnumber every bar after it and make the part useless against the rest
 * of the band.

/**
 * Which line to take where a part is divided.
 *
 * Brass band bass parts are written divided on one stave — most often the same
 * note an octave apart — and the section agrees who plays which. The app cannot
 * know that agreement, so it asks rather than choosing.
 *
 * **One line is read, not both**, because a choice is unavoidable: `NoteEvent`
 * holds one pitch and one sounding note, so exactly one notehead is drawn and
 * exactly one octave is heard. Drawing two while sounding one and accepting
 * either would be three different stories on one stem — the fault v1.33.0
 * exists to prevent.
 *
 * **What the choice does not cost is the fingering.** A tuba's octave is the
 * same valve combination on a different harmonic, so at the octave — which is
 * how a bass part nearly always divides — either line drills the same thing,
 * and picking the one your section did not give you costs you the octave you
 * read and hear rather than the practice. Where a part divides by something
 * other than an octave the fingerings do differ, and then the choice is the
 * whole of it.
