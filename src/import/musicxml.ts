/**
 * Reading navigation out of a MusicXML document.
 *
 * The half of the importer that touches the format. `unfold.ts` holds the
 * algorithm and knows nothing about XML; this knows about XML and holds no
 * algorithm, which is why the algorithm can be tested on structures written by
 * hand and this can be tested on documents written by hand.
 *
 * **The semantic layer, not the printed one.** Navigation appears twice in
 * MusicXML: as marks to engrave (`<words>D.S. al Coda</words>`, `<segno/>`)
 * and as `<sound>` attributes that exist so that software can play the piece.
 * The second is what is read, because it *names* its targets — a piece with two
 * segnos is unambiguous — and because the first would mean parsing English.
 *
 * The one concession: an engraved `<segno/>` or `<coda/>` with no `<sound>`
 * beside it still registers the mark, under no name. Exporters that write the
 * sign but not the semantics are common enough that refusing them would cost
 * more than the concession does, and an unnamed mark answers to any name, so a
 * part with one segno works and a part with two still needs the labels.
