 *
 * Every one of these is diatonic to the key, or is one of the two minor scales

 * Eb should contain the notes of Eb and nothing else. Patterns built on the
 * tonic but borrowed from another mode — a parallel minor, or a flat-seventh
 * chord on the tonic — look like heavy chromaticism against the key signature,
 * which is not what anyone means by "scales and arpeggios".
 *
 * The dominant seventh is diatonic precisely because it is built on the fifth
 * degree, not the first: in Eb that is Bb D F Ab, all in key. The minor
 * arpeggio and the minor scales likewise sit on the sixth degree — the
 * relative minor's tonic — and take the key's own signature, which is how a
 * book prints them: D minor is written with F major's one flat.
 *
 * **Which letter, not only which semitone.** The harmonic minor's raised
 * seventh in D minor is C sharp, and the key's flat would spell that sound as
 * D flat. A scale is one note per letter, so each note here carries its letter
 * step above the root and the spelling follows it — see `spellDrillNote`. For
 * every diatonic drill that comes out exactly as the signature would have
 * spelled it, so nothing changed for them.
 *
 * `cycles` is how many times through — up and back down — one sitting opens
 * on: a judgement, not a derivation, pinned by a test. A chord's cycle is
 * half the notes of a scale's, so the chords get twice as many.
