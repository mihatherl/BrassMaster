 *
 * Its own module because two things need it and neither owns it. Free material
 * and patterns arrive here from `generate.ts` having chosen their pitches by
 * walking or by contour; an authored theme arrives from `theme.ts` having been
 * told them. What happens after that point is identical, and has to stay
 * identical — a second copy of this would be a second set of rules about when a
 * note is beamed and when it takes an accidental.
