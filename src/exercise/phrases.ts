/**
 * Themes, stitched from tunes — composed for the exercise, since v2.20.0, by
 * `compose.ts`; hand-written before that.
 *
 * Themes are laid end to end until the asked-for length is reached. The join is
 * why every theme starts and ends on a stable degree: two arbitrary phrases
 * butted together sound like a mistake, and one ending on the leading note
 * followed by one starting on the sixth sounds like a page turned two bars
 * early.
 *
 * Length is a count of themes, not a number of bars — the same reason a pattern
 * is measured in cycles. A theme is a written shape and how many bars it fills
 * is its own business, so asking for twelve bars of them asks for one and a
 * half of something meant to be played whole.
 *
 * The key set is dealt across those themes in contiguous blocks, exactly as a
 * pattern deals its keys across cycles, and a change lands only where one theme
 * ends and the next begins. Changing key inside a tune that was not written to
 * do so is a signature laid over somebody else's phrase.
