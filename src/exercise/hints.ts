/**
 * Fingering hints: the answer written over the notes that keep going wrong.
 *
 * **What a mistake here actually means, and why the trouble is filed under the
 * written note.** With valve buttons and no microphone, the app sees which
 * combination went down and nothing else. It cannot tell a player who chose the
 * wrong fingering from one who chose the right fingering and mispitched, so it
 * must not pretend to teach either — what it *can* see is whether a note on the
 * page was recognised and answered. So trouble is filed under the written note,
 * exactly as it appears on the stave for this instrument and clef, and it does
 * not travel:
 *
 *  - **Not to other notes sharing its fingering.** That would be a claim about
 *    the valve combination, which is the thing the app cannot yet see.
 *  - **Not to the same letter in another octave.** The player's own case, and
 *    the clearest statement of what this feature is for: *I don't know what
 *    high B looks like, but I have no trouble with the B above middle C.* Those
 *    are two different reading problems and only one of them wants prompting.
 *
 * When the microphone lands this gets revisited: a wrong fingering and a right
 * fingering mispitched are different faults with different answers, and only
 * then can the two be told apart. Until then, this is note recognition.
 *
 * **A hint answers a mistake, and it answers it now.** The history a player
 * brings to a run decides which notes open with one; a note that goes wrong
 * during the run gets one immediately — over the note that went wrong, where
 * the eye already is, and over every later note of that pitch. A list of the
 * last few notes played used to carry that job and the player's verdict on it
 * is why it does not: *you can never pay enough attention to it to see what the
 * fingering was supposed to be.* The answer has to be on the note.
 *
 * **And it stops when it is no longer needed.** Two of that note played right
 * and the prompting stops, so the page quietens as the player improves. Which
 * is feedback in itself, and the reason the old "a hint that came and went
 * would be worse than none" is not violated: this one goes away for a reason
 * the player can feel.
 *
 * **A wrong answer and no answer are not the same evidence.** Wrong valves are
 * a fingering that was reached for and missed, and prompt at once. A missed
 * note is nothing held at all, which is as likely to mean the player was lost,
 * or behind, or resting a lip — so it takes two before it prompts.
 *
 * **A note in a run still gets its hint, if it has earned one.** There used to
 * be a rule that a note with less than a fifth of a second before the next one
 * was past helping, and it withheld hints from fast passages — which is where a
 * struggling player is most likely to be lost. The rule was also measuring the
 * wrong thing. It measured how long the *note* lasts, but the strike line sits
 * near the left of the display and the paged screen shows the whole page: a
 * hint is on screen, and readable, for seconds before its note is played. What
 * a run really costs is the ability to *act* on one mid-flight, and a hint you
 * could not act on this time is still the answer to a mistake you just made and
 * still there on the way round again.
 *
 * So in *where I struggle*, a hint prints wherever it physically fits, and
 * whether it fits is decided later when the layout is known; see
 * `drawFingeringHint`. In *every note* the timing rule stays, since that mode
 * is printing over music nothing is wrong with and a run of semiquavers under a
 * wall of digits helps nobody — hence `retime`, since the player can change the
 * tempo mid-run.
 *
 * **There is no cap on how many.** There was one — at most one a bar — and the
 * player asked for it gone: fingerings are what this app teaches, and a run
 * that has earned eight of them should be given eight.
