/*
 * The forty-seven hand-written tunes, recovered for review.
 *
 * Retired in v2.20.0 when Themes became composed from cells, and brought back
 * on 2026-08-20 to be judged rather than assumed. **Nothing in the app imports
 * this**, so none of it reaches a player: it exists to be listened to on
 * `npm run themes-sheet`, which plays each tune and measures it against the
 * level it claims.
 *
 * Two things to know before judging them, both from the corpus's own original
 * header, which is kept below:
 *
 * 1. They were retired for **calibration** — a level or two easy at every
 *    level — not for being tunes. That failure is now caught automatically by
 *    `validateTheme` and the measurement held as a test.
 * 2. But they also say of themselves that they are *"deliberately plain: the
 *    point of the first few is that the path works end to end … not that the
 *    tunes are memorable."* So the question a review has to answer is not only
 *    whether they are labelled right, but whether they are melodies at all.
 */

/*
 * The theme corpus.
 *
 * Written by hand to prove the format before there is a hundred of anything.
 * These are deliberately plain: the point of the first few is that the path
 * works end to end — degrees in, spelled into the player's key, engraved,
 * playable — not that the tunes are memorable.
 *
 * Each one is built the way a phrase is built rather than the way a sequence
 * is: a figure, then the same figure answered, then a cadence. That structure
 * is the whole reason this corpus exists, since a random walk cannot produce
 * it, and it is what makes material readable at sight.
 *
 * Rules every theme here obeys, all of them checked by `validateTheme`:
 * both ends sit on a stable degree so any two themes can abut; nothing crosses
 * a bar line except as a tie; and the beats add up to the bars declared.

/*
 * Two figuration variations on the same tune, written to be compared.
 *
 * The idea: each bar keeps one note of the melody, on the first quaver, and
 * spends the rest of the bar arpeggiating around it. That is a real and old
 * device — it is what Mozart's variations do to this very tune — and the tune
 * survives it, because the ear picks the downbeats out of the figuration and
 * hears the melody underneath.
 *
 * Where the two differ is which triad gets arpeggiated, and it is worth hearing
 * rather than being told:
 *
 * `twinkle-centred` takes the triad *centred* on the melody note — a third
 * below and a third above — so the melody note always sits in the middle of its
 * own figure. Neat, symmetrical, and harmonically loose: on the melody's fifth
 * it produces the mediant where the tune wants the tonic, so the bar leans
 * somewhere the tune does not.
 *
 * `twinkle-figured` arpeggiates the chord the bar is actually in, arranged so
 * the melody note is one of its notes. Less tidy as a rule, and it is what the
 * harmony is doing anyway.
 *
 * One melody note per bar reduces the tune to its downbeats, which is the usual
 * price of this device and part of why it is a hard read: the player is holding
 * a tune that is only implied.
