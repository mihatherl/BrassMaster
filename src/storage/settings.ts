 * A chosen range, forced inside what the instrument can play.

 * every written pitch, and a range chosen in treble names different numbers in
 * bass. Clearing would silently drop a choice on a mis-tap; clamping keeps it,
 * and the stave beside the control shows where it ended up.
 *
 * Anything that is not two numbers is nobody's choice, and goes back to null —
 * which is the difficulty deciding, not a range of none.
