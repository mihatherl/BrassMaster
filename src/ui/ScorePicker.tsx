/**
 * Choosing which bars of a part to practise.
 *
 * The part is drawn as it is printed — repeats shown once, in the order they
 * sit on the page — because bars are chosen off the page. A player looking for
 * "the awkward bit at 33" is looking at their own printed part, and a view that
 * had already unfolded the repeats would number its bars differently from the
 * paper on the stand.
 *
 * Selecting is two taps: one on the first bar of a run, one on the last. A
 * third run can be added, and a fourth, and they are played one after another
 * with a bar of rests between. Tapping inside a run that is already chosen
 * takes it out again, which is the only way to undo something on a screen with
 * no room for a control beside every bar.
 *
 * The drawing is `render/review.ts`, which already lays a whole exercise out
 * into wrapped, justified systems and knows where every bar landed. Nothing
 * about a score view is different from the marked review except what is washed
 * behind the bars, so it would have been a poor thing to build twice.

          It says what to do, then what you have chosen — and it is here rather
          than above the score for two reasons. Under the score it sat behind
          this very strip, so the one piece of confirmation on the screen was
          the one thing you could not see. And a line that comes and goes
          changes the height of a *fixed* strip, which pushes the page around
          and can bring in a scrollbar; the score is laid out against the width
          that scrollbar takes, so every selection nudged the whole thing.

          Named in the printed numbers, because that is what the player checks
          against the part on the stand.
