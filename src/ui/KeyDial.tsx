/**
 * The key, under the player's hand while they are playing.
 *
 * The third dial in the app and the same gesture as the other two, but the one
 * that differs in what a turn *costs*. Moving the tempo is a number the clock
 * reads next beat; moving the key rewrites every bar the player has not reached
 * yet. So this dial separates turning from choosing: the face follows the finger
 * detent by detent, and the music is rewritten once, when the finger comes off.
 *
 * That is not for the sake of the work — two hundred bars regenerate in a few
 * milliseconds, which was measured before this was built rather than assumed.
 * It is because **a key is a destination and not a path**. Sliding from one flat
 * to two sharps passes through C and G, and putting those on the page on the way
 * would show the player two keys they did not ask for and respell the music
 * twice to do it.
 *
 * **Where the change lands is part of the reading.** A key signature has to be
 * seen before the bar it governs, so the change goes in at a bar line ahead of
 * the playhead — and while the dial is turning, the callout says which bar, so
 * the player knows whether the change is coming in time to matter to the phrase
 * they are in.
