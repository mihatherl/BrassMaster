          One box per material, and the open one is the material.

          Chosen over a chooser with the settings underneath it, on the player's
          call and for the reason they gave: presented with too many options at
          once, attention snaps. Most of what used to be on this screen applies
          to one material and is noise beside the others — a register is a
          question about where a scale sits and means nothing to a written tune,
          a range is a question about the pool free material is drawn from and
          means nothing to either.

          **Opening a box is choosing that material.** Deliberately not two
          separate things: a selected box and an expanded box are two states
          saying almost the same thing, and two states saying almost the same
          thing can disagree — the screen would then have to answer what it means
          to expand Themes while Scales is selected, and there is no good answer.
          So there is one state, `settings.kind`, and the open box shows it.

          Which is also why the open box does not close. Closing it would leave
          no material chosen, and an exercise has to be made of something. The
          button carries both `aria-pressed` and `aria-expanded` because both are
          true of it and neither implies the other to a screen reader.
