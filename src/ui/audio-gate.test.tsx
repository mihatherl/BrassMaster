 * What the gate does when the sound cannot be brought up.
 *
 * The one thing past "Tap to start" that can be tested without a real
 * AudioContext, and it is worth testing because the failure it guards against
 * is *silence with no message* — the app looking as though it is playing while
 * nothing can be heard, which is the hardest fault for a player to report and
 * the easiest for anyone to mistake for a bug in the music.
 *
 * The context module is faked here rather than the browser: `ensureRunning`
 * answers whether the clock is genuinely moving, and this test is about the
 * screen's answer to *no*.
