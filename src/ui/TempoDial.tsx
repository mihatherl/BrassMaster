/**
 * The tempo, under the player's hand while they are playing.
 *
 * A dial rather than a slider, on the player's call: a slider has to fit the
 * whole range — forty to two hundred and twenty — into whatever width is beside
 * the stave, which makes every pixel worth a couple of beats a minute and turns
 * "a shade slower" into a lottery. A dial gives the same finger travel to every
 * beat a minute wherever it starts from. Going from 140 to 80 then takes
 * several spins, which is the trade and the right way round: the small
 * adjustment is the one made constantly.
 *
 * **The reading is on the face, and again above it while turning.** On the face
 * because that is where a control's setting belongs and it is legible at a
 * glance the rest of the time; above it while a finger is on it because the
 * finger is covering the face, and the other hand is on the valves with the eye
 * on the stave. The callout is the trick a phone keyboard uses for the key
 * under the thumb, for the same reason.
 *
 * The face is a knurled wheel that turns with the finger. It carries no scale:
 * a wheel showing where forty and two hundred are would be a slider again, with
 * the same problem in a smaller space.
