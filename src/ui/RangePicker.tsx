/**
 * Choosing the notes free material is drawn from.
 *
 * Two ends and a stave. The stave draws them because that is where a player
 * reads a note — the same reasoning `note-chart.ts` sets out for the weak-note
 * chart: a letter and an octave number ask the reader to translate, and
 * translating is the very thing someone practising this is not yet fluent at.
 * The fingering sits over each, from the same `drawFingeringHint` the play
 * surface uses, so a bound reads as a note you can put your fingers on.
 *
 * A dial either side of the stave moves them — the lower on the left, the upper
 * on the right, the way the two notes are drawn and the way a stave is read.
 * Beneath the notes to begin with, which was clearer about which dial went with
 * which note and cost twice the height: this is a settings screen where every
 * row is between a player and the Start button, and one row of controls beside
 * a figure is worth more than a diagram of itself. They turn in stave steps
 * within the key, which is the unit the figure is drawn in: one turn of a dial,
 * one line or space.
 *
 * Neither dial may pass the other. Blocking rather than shoving is deliberate —
 * a dial that pushed its neighbour along would move a note the player was not
 * touching, and the pair would drift up the horn together with no way to see
 * why. Stopped against each other, the two can still meet on one note, which is
 * a legitimate thing to ask for and reads as one.
 *
 * Free material only: a scale is placed by its tonic and asks `register` where
 * to sit, and a theme finds its own octave from the degrees it is written in.
 * Neither would mean the same thing by a range, so neither is offered one.
