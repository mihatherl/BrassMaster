/**

 *
 * The observation that asked for this, made on an iPhone against three
 * outputs: the phone's own speaker sounds the note on the beat, a pair of
 * over-ear headphones sounds it a little late, and a pair of earbuds sounds it
 * a lot late. Bluetooth buffers the sound on its way to the ear, each device
 * by its own amount, and nothing the app can read reports how much reliably — so the
 * player measures it, once per device, by tapping along with a click — the
 * browser's own `outputLatency` estimate is shown as a starting point, and
 * deliberately never applied by itself, having been measured wrong by most of
 * a second on real hardware. The
 * measurement is kept under the device's name and the sound is brought
 * forward by that much whenever the device is chosen. See
 * `Transport.audioLead` for what "brought forward" means.
 *
 * Its own screen rather than a slider in Advanced, because a number of
 * milliseconds is not something a player can set by looking at it. The click
 * has to be running while it is set.
