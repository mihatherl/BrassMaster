/**
 * Judging.
 *
 * A note is correct if the player answered it at any point in a window around
 * its onset. *Answered* is the input's own word — see `PlayerInput.answers`,
 * which is where the buttons keep what a valve combination means, and where a
 * microphone would keep what a pitch means. This file owns the window and
 * nothing about the instrument.
 *
 * Two consequences of that phrasing are deliberate:
 *
 *  - Consecutive notes sharing a fingering need no release and re-press. A
 *    player holding 1-2 through four notes that all use 1-2 is playing
 *    correctly, and would be wrong to lift.
 *  - Getting there slightly early still counts, which matches how valves are
 *    actually used — you set the fingering, then blow.
 *
 * Ties never reach here. The far end of one is not played, so the session
 * passes over it rather than presenting it for a verdict — see `ties.ts`. What
 * does arrive is the head of the tie, carrying the length of the whole chain,
 * since that is how long the note it stands for actually sounds.
