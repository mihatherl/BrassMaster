/**
 * Valve input: the buttons, and what a combination of them means.
 *
 * The `PlayerInput` the app has always had, and — until a microphone arrives —
 * the only one. Records a timestamped history of button states rather than
 * exposing only the live state, because judging needs to ask "was this
 * combination held at any point around this note's onset", a question the
 * current state cannot answer. Timestamps come from the audio clock so they are
 * directly comparable with scheduled note times.
 *
 * Touch and keyboard are tracked separately and combined, so a finger and a key
 * holding the same valve do not cancel each other out.
 *
 * Everything the *buttons* make of what they record is here too — see
 * `answers`. That is the seam: a microphone brings its own history and its own
 * reading of it, and nothing downstream changes.

   * Whether a held button state answers a note.
   *
   * Any accepted fingering that takes a valve — the primary, or an alternate
   * such as 1-3 for a G — is a deliberate act and answers on its own. Open is
   * accepted only from a player who is engaged: it is what an instrument on
   * its owner's lap produces too, and until v2.21.0 a run played by nobody
   * scored every open note correct, which on an E flat bass part was a quarter
   * of the score for doing nothing.
   *
   * **The window is the run, and it used to be two notes.** The player's rule
   * of 2026-08-16 read *an open note counts if some fingering was played on at
   * least one of the two notes before it*, and `activeSince` walks back exactly
   * two playable notes to find it. That fails on a passage of open notes, which
   * contains no evidence to find: the last valved note stays in range for
   * precisely two open notes and then falls out, so a tune sitting on the
   * harmonic series scored *correct, correct, and then nothing at all*.
   * Reported from Jingle Bells and reproduced, 2026-08-24.
   *
   * The intent survives and only the window changes: a player who has pressed
   * any valve this run has shown they are here, and an instrument on a lap
   * never presses one, so it still scores nothing. What the two-note window
   * bought — catching a run played by nobody — is now held more securely a
   * level up: `wasAttempted` in `judge.ts` refuses to file such a run at all,
   * which no per-note rule could do.
   *
   * **Still unfixed, deliberately**: a tune with no valved note *anywhere*
   * never gathers evidence, so only its first note can count. The exception
   * that would fix it — where the exercise offers no evidence, do not judge —
   * hands an unattended instrument full marks on exactly those tunes, so it
   * waits for a real tune to run into the problem.
   *
   * **A rule about buttons, and it lives with them for that reason.** With
   * buttons, an open note and an abandoned instrument are the same input, so
   * the evidence has to be borrowed. A microphone hears the difference and will
   * want nothing of the kind — which is why the judge no longer knows this rule
   * exists.
