/**
 * The seam, driven by something that is not the buttons.
 *
 * The point of `PlayerInput` is that the microphone will be a new *input* and
 * nothing else: the same session, the same judge, the same tone following the
 * same answers. That claim is worth an implementation to test it with, so this
 * file has one — a listening input that reports stretches of heard sound
 * instead of held buttons — and runs whole sessions off it.
 *
 * `HeardInput` is not the microphone and is not trying to be: it has no
 * detector, no onset measurement and no pitch. It is the smallest thing that
 * is *not the buttons*, which is all that is needed to prove that nothing
 * downstream of the seam knows which side of it the answers came from.
