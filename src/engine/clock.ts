   * milliseconds — and reading it once per frame then makes notes jump in
   * chunks, which looks like a badly dropped frame rate and makes it genuinely
   * hard to see when a note meets the line.
   *
   * So: anchor to the audio clock whenever it ticks, and fill the gaps between
   * ticks from the wall clock. Because it re-anchors on every real update this
   * cannot drift — and since `currentTime` reports the *last completed* quantum,
   * extrapolating forward is closer to the truth rather than further from it.
   *
   * Judging deliberately does not use this. Only the eye needs interpolation.
   *
   * **And it only ever goes forward.** `currentTime` does not advance smoothly:
   * it can sit still for longer than a quantum and then move by one quantum
   * rather than by the wall time that has passed. Extrapolation runs at wall
   * rate meanwhile, so it ends up ahead, and re-anchoring to the audio clock's
   * own figure steps the reported beat *backwards* — measured in a browser at
   * several times a minute, by up to three hundredths of a beat.
   *
   * Too small to see as motion, and not too small to matter: anything keeping
   * state off this number sees a position that has gone back. The paged reader
   * turns the page back when the bar being played is behind the page's start,
   * so a step back across a bar line in the frame after a page turn takes the
   * page with it — the music flipping up towards the start and then returning,
   * which is how the player reported it. A page turn happens on a bar line,
   * which is exactly where a step this small can cross one.
   *
   * So the interpolated position is held at its high-water mark rather than
   * allowed to retreat: it stalls for the few milliseconds the audio clock takes
   * to catch up, and moves again after. Stalling is what this already does when
   * the clock stops altogether, and it is the honest failure — the music has not
   * gone backwards, so the display must not say it has. The mark is dropped
   * wherever position genuinely moves backwards, which is the transport's own
   * doing and never the clock's: starting, pausing and seeking, below.
