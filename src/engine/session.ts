     *
     * *Within one piece*, a metre change is the composer's, and the convention
     * where nothing is marked is that the note value carries across: 2/4 into
     * 6/8 is quaver = quaver, so the crotchet holds its length and the new
     * dotted-crotchet pulse is half again as long. That is the reading an
     * imported part gets, and the metre list was built for it.
     *
     * *Between pieces*, there is no such continuity to keep. A medley hands
     * over from one tune to another and the dial's number means the pulse of
     * whichever is playing — 80 in nine-eight is 80 dotted crotchets, 80 in
     * four-four is 80 crotchets, which is what a conductor means by it.
     * Reported by ear on 2026-08-21: Jesu Joy into Invention 13 at 80 "seemed
     * a whole lot faster… maybe about 120", which is 80 x 1.5, the crotchet
     * rate carried across a seam where nothing should have carried.
     *
     * The seams are the theme starts, which `labels` already names — so a
     * metre change at a label is a new piece and re-reads the dial, and one
     * anywhere else is the composer's and does not. Imported music has no
