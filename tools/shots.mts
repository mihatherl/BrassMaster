/**
 * Drives the real app in a real browser and photographs it, at the sizes that
 * actually decide the layout.
 *
 * This exists because the suite cannot see the play screen. Its whole geometry
 * comes from `staveSpaceCeiling` against the viewport, and the faults that have
 * got through here were all *positional* — notes drawn below the last stave, a
 * notehead clipped by the left edge — which every passing test was blind to
 * because they measure notes relative to each other. The engraving snapshots
 * cover the notation; nothing but a browser covers the page around it.
 *
 * It was a throwaway script rebuilt from memory each time before this, so the
 * viewport list — the part worth keeping — was rewritten each time too.
 *
 *   npm run shots                      every viewport, both screens
 *   npm run shots -- --tier free       the gated build's settings screen
 *   npm run shots -- --theme dark
 *   npm run shots -- --viewport phone-landscape --screen play
 *   npm run shots -- --url http://localhost:5173
 *
 * The output is *not* committed and is not a snapshot: screenshots vary with
 * the host's fonts and GPU, so diffing them across machines would cry wolf. The
 * committed byte-for-byte check is the SVG one in `engraving.test.ts`. These
 * are for looking at.

/**
 * Sizes chosen against the breakpoints in `index.css`, not from a device list.
 *
 * The rule that matters is `(orientation: landscape) and (max-height: 32rem)` —
 * sideways *and short*, meaning a phone on its side and nothing else. A tablet
 * turned sideways and a desktop window are both landscape with height to
 * spare, and they took the phone's concessions for a long time, most visibly
 * losing the conductor on a monitor. So both sides of that line are here.
 *
 * There is deliberately nothing near 32rem: the CSS says a phone sideways tops
 * out around 27rem and the smallest tablet has 46rem, so the line sits in open
 * country and a viewport placed on it would be testing a case no device is in.
 *
 * `phone-small` is the one entry that comes from a device rather than a
 * breakpoint, and it earns the exception: it is the Moto E32 that is now in the
 * room and will be doing the container spike, the settings screen is reported
 * to overflow on it, and "a case no device is in" is exactly what this one is
 * not. 360x740 is also the narrowest Android worth caring about, so it is the
 * floor for every screen and not only the one that failed.
